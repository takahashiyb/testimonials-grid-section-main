## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to stop insisting on pushing for diplay: flex; what could be done in display: grid;. I tried doing it in flex because I wanted every testimonial to be in one div and that I would not be relying on styling for each specific testimonial. When I had a hard time finishing it, I chose to go for what feels more familiar and use grid. That is probably the solution that is expected, but I was too stubborn to pick it. Otherwise, I learned about a lot about flex like changing flex-basis to 0 just squishing my div, and the flex shorthand syntax as alternative to the usual.

### Continued development

For future developments, I think I need to know the optimal way to do things that could quickly be modularized. Also just learning how to see a fruitless endeavor when I see one. Though I am still holding out hope that I find a solution for this challenge in the way that I hoped I could.
